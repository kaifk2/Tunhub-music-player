Project: TunHub - Song Playing Website
TunHub is a Spring Boot-powered song playing website that I designed and developed from scratch, combining HTML, CSS, MySQL, and API testing to ensure seamless functionality. This platform boasts a vast music library, an intuitive user interface, and a secure payment gateway for premium features. Users can explore genres, create playlists, and effortlessly share their favorite tunes with friends and family. TunHub offers an immersive music experience, making it the perfect destination for music enthusiasts to discover, enjoy, and share their passion for music.
